## Logical Fallacies & Postmodernism: A respository of examples in everyday life

[Client Website will be posted here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfredo-rafael/)
# Story of my logical-fallacies' website

This repository is develop as a continuation of my previous [Client Website](https://alfredrafael.github.io/logical-fallacy-client/) "Logical fallacies: A repository of user generated examples". Is also uses its database code. 

![alt text](http://public/projectScreenshot.png)

Rationale:

Postmodernism radical ideology have spiked violence across the USA, and the Western World. The good news are: knowing the logical flaws within these ideologies might be able to help us from the chaos they produce! A as a developer who taught elementary and high school students, I am fascinated by philosophy and the ways in which it can improve our lives. To learn how to deconstruct logical fallacies in others' arguments, and IDENTIFYING faults in our own is a life-skill that can make our lives so much richer. By learning the terminology used to refer to certian logical fallacies, we become able to IDENTIFY them (in others, or even within our own heads) and therefore curve our behavior with a more productive and solid response.

The purpose of this website is to expose the user to these ancient vocabulary words, allowing him/her to identify logical fallacies in the future, and to allow users to provide their own examples.


## User story

- As a user, I can see examples of logical fallacies without having to create an account. 
- As a user, I can create an account (sign in) in and log in into the account I created.

- As a user, I can contribute my own example of a logical fallacy.

- As a user, I can see other people's examples of logical fallacies.

- As a user, I can delelete my own examples of logical fallacies.

- As a user, I can edit my own example.

## Technologies used

- HTML5
- CSS / SCSS / React-Bootstrap
- React.js
- Ruby on Rails on the server side can be found [here](https://github.com/alfredrafael/logical-fallacy-server)

## WireFrame and ERD

This project's precoursor can be found [here](https://github.com/alfredrafael/logical-fallacy-client). However, I decided to create another version of the same concept using react & react-bootstrap. 

Differences: 

-Instead of having to log-in to see the logical-fallacies study, the user will have access to these without having to sign in.

-I look forward to creating a dropdown menu that will be populated by the database.

-Instead of a "scroll all the way down" website, this one will render a complete different view every time the user selects an option from the navbar. Oh! And talking about navbars...

-This application will provide a "hamburger menu" and readability when using on a mobile device.
